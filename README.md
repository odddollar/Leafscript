# Leafscript
Leafscript is a lightweight programming language created as a proof of concept by someone with no idea how to write a language.
It's written entirely in Golang, so can be compiled from source using the command:

```go build main.go```

It supports:
- Creating and modifying variables (strings, ints and floats)
- Performing mathematical operations on numeric variables
- String concatenation
- For loops
- If/else statements
- Breaks in for loops

Currently working on:
- Nested if/for
- Error messages

No plans to implement in near future
- Array variables

Language examples are contained within the "Examples" file
